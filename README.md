### Introduction
Classify structure of proteins is an important task in biology. In particoular the secondary structure of a protein is determined by the geometric distribution of the amino acid residues. There are $2$ main secondary structures:

# <center>Beta Sheet</center>

### PNAS Features
The chain of the carbon atoms $\{C_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha = 1 \dots N}$ (where $N$ is the length of the protein), is the backbone of the spatial structure of the protein.

In this work we try to classify the structure of **Inserise numero esatto** protein. We get the coordinations of the $C_{\alpha}$ from the [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/) downloading the `.pdb` files and cleaning it to get the $C_\alpha$s.

For our project we have followed the main idea of this paper: "[Automatic classification of protein structure by using
Gauss integrals](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2636460100)" by Peter RÃ¸gen and Boris Fain, from now on we will refer to it as *PNAS* for simplicity.

We map the protein's geometry into a topological curve and compute the Writhe $W_r$.

The Writhe of a curve $\gamma$ may be calculated via Gauss integral in this way:  

$W_r(\gamma) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int \int_{\gamma \times \gamma\ D} \omega(t_1,t_2)\,dt_1\,dt_2 $

where $\omega(t_1,t_2)=\frac{\left[\gamma'(t_1),\gamma(t_1)-\gamma(t_2),\gamma'(t_2)\right]}{\left|\gamma(t_1)-\gamma(t_2) \right|^3}$, $D$ is the diagonal of $\gamma\times\gamma$ and $\left[\gamma'(t_1),\gamma(t_1)-\gamma(t_2),\gamma'(t_2)\right]$ the triple scalar product. 

As $\omega(t_1,t_2)=\omega(t_2,t_1)$ we can use this simpler formula:

$$
W_r(\gamma) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int
$$

We have a polygonal so we can use a more simple definition:

$W_r(\mu) = \sum _{0<i_1<i_2<N}W(i_1,i_2)$

with

$W(i_1,i_2)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{i_1=t_1}^{i_1+1}\int_{i_2=t_2}^{i_2+1}\omega(t_1,t_2)\,dt_1\,dt_2$

where $W(i_1, i_2)$ is the contribution to writhe coming from the i 1th
and the i 2th line segments, which equals the probability from an
arbitrary direction to see the i1th and the i2th line segment cross,
multiplied by the sign of this crossing

### PNAS Features

Following the *PNAS* we have computed a family of $14$ structural measures, they are computed as follows:

$I_{(1,2)}(\mu)= \sum _{0<i_1<i_2<N}W\left(i_1,i_2\right)$

$I_{|1,2|(3,5)}(\mu)= \sum_{0<i_1<i_2<i_3<i_5<N}\left|W(i_1,i_2)\right|W\left(i_3,i_5\right)\\$

### New Features
We propose a new kind of features whose computation is faster than the PNAS' ones. The calculations is based on a matrix of "nearest neighbor interaction", we compute the $\omega(t_1,t_2)$ only for the NN segments and then the definitions of the $I$-s are the same.

In this case the features are only local so they do not give an optimal representation of the whole protein, but only a local one.

### CATH

We follow the classification convention of the [CATH](https://www.cathdb.info/) database, every protein is classified with a number for its **C**lass, its **A**rchitecture,its **T**opology and its **H**omogous superfamily. 

In the next few slides we will show the division by class:
1. Mainly $\alpha$.
2. Mainly $\beta$.
3. Both $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
4. Few secondary structure.
6. Special

The project is divided in three sub-parts:

- Download the `.pdb` files of the proteins, separate it in the chains and compute the features.
- Clustering using `KNeighborsClassifier` and `DBSCAN`.
- Classification via neural networks.
